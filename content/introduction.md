# Introduction to microdata 

_Microdata_ refers to non-aggregated data where each record represents a person, household, or other unit of observation. In a survey microdata file, every record represents _one survey response_. 

Microdata is sometimes described in relation to  _statistics_.


| Statistics | Microdata |
| --- | --- |
| Aggregated calculations that describe and summarize (counts, averages, etc)<br/><br/>Easier to communicate but <b>not flexible</b>: what you see is what you get | Non-aggregated data that researchers can combine as they please <br/><br/>Can answer follow-up questions raised by statistics:<br/><i>How does that differ by province? by age group?</i>  |


## Public Use Microdata Files (PUMFs)

_Public Use Microdata Files_ (PUMFs) is the term Statistics Canada uses for non-aggregated data it releases for public use. PUMFs are released under the [Statistics Canada Open Licence](https://statcan.gc.ca/reference/licence){:target="_blank"} and can be used with very few restrictions, as long as Statistics Canada is acknowledged as the source.

PUMFs take precautions to protect respondent privacy:

- Some variables are suppressed _(e.g. smaller geographic areas)_
- Some variables are aggregated _(e.g. age, income)_
- Might only be a sample of responses _(e.g. Census of Canada PUMFs)_

These privacy precautions mean PUMFs are not suitable for some research projects, but for many others they are a quick way to access high quality data about Canadians.

Researchers who need data that's not available to the public might benefit from the [Real Time Remote Access (RTRA)](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/microdata/rtra){:target="_blank"} and [Research Data Centre (RDC)](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/microdata/data-centres){:target="_blank"} programs.

## Statistics Canada PUMFs at UBC Library

Even though they're public, PUMFs can be difficult to find on the Statistics Canada website. Our recommended source for PUMFs is [Abacus](https://abacus.library.ubc.ca/){:target="_blank"}, UBC Library's data repository.

Visit the [Statistics Canada Open License collection in Abacus](https://abacus.library.ubc.ca/dataverse/statcan-public){:target="_blank"} and search or browse to find PUMFs for these high profile Statistics Canada surveys, along with _many_ others:

- Census of Canada
- Canadian Community Health Survey
- Canadian Housing Survey
- Canadian Income Survey
- Canadian Internet Use Survey
- Canadian Tobacco and Nicotine Survey
