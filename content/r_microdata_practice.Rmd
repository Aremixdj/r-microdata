### Practice #1 

Refer to the Create summary tables section of the content covered during the workshop to try generating your own summary table.

Copy the two-variable example and try one or more of the following:

-   Create your own table with different variables.
-   Swap the *by* and *include* variables. How does this affect the percentages?
-   Remove the *include* part of the command. What happens?
-   **Advanced**: consult the *tbl_svysummary* documentation and figure out how to display all percentages to one decimal place.
